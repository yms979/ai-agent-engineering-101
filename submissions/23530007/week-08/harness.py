"""Calls the harness (Claude Code, non-interactive) and reads one JSON object from its answer.

The harness runs in a fresh empty directory so it picks up no project instructions, gets the
prompt on stdin, and has no tools. Both agents use this module; neither contains a model of its own.

  HARNESS_CMD   override the command (default: claude -p with haiku, no tools, no settings)

Circuit breaker (Round 3, nobody watching): when a call gets no JSON on both attempts (timeout, harness missing,
login expired, rate limit, error text), every agent skips the harness for OPEN_FOR seconds and its code rules
answer instead. The state is one file shared by the seller and every buyer run; the first call after OPEN_FOR
tries the harness again and closes the breaker if it answers.
