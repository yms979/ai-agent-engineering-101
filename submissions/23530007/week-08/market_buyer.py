"""Week 07 market buyer: read the shops and their reviews, pick one, talk the price down, review it.

    python market_buyer.py --shops shops.json --item lamp --budget 120

{shops} is a JSON list of {"name", "url", "reviews": [{"stars", "review", "round"}]}, newest first.

1. Which shop to enter. Each shop becomes one line: review count and average stars, the newest review
   texts, red flags found in reviews (overcharged, receipt higher than agreed, ...), and what my own
   memory says about it (past deals, prices, a receipt that did not match). The harness reads those
   lines and picks a shop, with a reason. The code then applies two rules, whatever the harness says:
     - a shop my memory caught cheating is never entered while another shop is listed
     - a shop whose reviews say it cheats (red flags, or average 2 stars or less over 2+ reviews)
       is not entered while a shop without such signs is listed
     - a shop whose last visit (within FAIL_MEMORY seconds) failed, by a connection or protocol
       error, by a rejection before any ask (market log 11-02: inextro answered "none in stock" to 228
       orders in a row while its reviews kept it first), or by a deal whose receipt had no sig_seller
       (it does not count in Round 2), is not
       entered while another shop is listed (market log 10-20: outseop-26510122 picked three times,
       ConnectError each time)
2. Too dear compared with others. If my memory has a lower price for this item at another shop that
   is in the list right now (a price I paid or an ask I was quoted), that price becomes my ceiling:
   I never offer above it, and if the shop will not come down to it, I walk away and buy nothing.
3. Talk and haggle. Each move comes from buyer.next_move with chat=True: the harness decides the move
   and writes one short sentence to the seller. The message carries exactly one number, the offer,
   so any shop reading "the first number" or "the last number" reads the right price.
4. Memory (buyer_memory.json): one record per order: shop name (URLs change on every restart), item,
   budget, outcome, price, the asks I saw, my last offer, whether the receipt matched. A receipt
   price above what I agreed marks the shop as dishonest for good.
5. Round 2. A deal counts only when its receipt is signed, names the ordered item, stays within the
   budget and carries a task id the market has not seen. Before I review, I check the receipt the
   same way: sig_seller present, item = the order, price <= the agreed offer and the budget,
   task = the A2A task id of my negotiation, and that task id never seen in an earlier receipt
   (a replayed receipt). A wrong price, item, task or a replay marks the shop dishonest; a missing
   signature marks it unsigned. Reviews from Round 2 are shown only for verified deals, so the shop
   view counts them apart and the harness is told to trust them more.
6. Output: why I picked the shop, then the result line the kit and the market test read:
   {"shop": <card URL>, "receipt": <data Part as received, or null>, "stars": 1-5, "review": "..."}
7. Round 3 (--order with "acceptable" SKUs). The order names a category; a deal is worth the SKU's list
   price to me (0 if food does not last use_within_hours, minus the price if goods break without warranty).
     - only shops whose offers hold an acceptable SKU in stock are considered
     - at the chosen shop I ask for the acceptable SKU with the highest list price within my budget
       ("I want to buy <name> (<sku>)", and for food how many hours it must last)
     - I never pay more than value_share of the list price, so every deal leaves a surplus; policy.py sets it
       by situation: 0.97 normally, 0.85 in the last 12 hours (shops clear stock), 0.99 when few orders close
     - the result line carries "accept": the market's certificate always; food must last
       use_within_hours + 1 h; goods must be grade A or B. The kit pays nothing if the checkout fails it
     - payments.jsonl tells me afterwards when the kit did not pay; that visit counts as failed
       (the shop stays out for FAIL_MEMORY), like a connection error
   Memory keys Round 3 trades by SKU, so "cheaper elsewhere" compares the same product.
   Broken goods: the kit writes only the item's name and when it broke to broken.jsonl. I match each line to
   my latest deal for that name within BREAK_WINDOW before it broke, mark that trade broken and count it
   against the shop (mem["broken"]); the shop view shows "N of M goods broke", and the fallback ranking and
   the harness see it.
9. Paying (optional midterm part): for a signed, honest Round 3 deal, acp_tools.pay() reads the shop's
   acp.json, builds tools from it and lets the model drive the checkout; code keeps the money checks and signs
   the closed mandates. The result line then carries "mandate_receipt" and our kit copy (market_kit.py) uses
   it; if this path does not finish, the kit pays as before.
10. Turned away (Round 3, 11-03: 63 of 212 orders ended on a shop that listed the SKU but had none left, as
   many as all our deals): a rejection before any ask or a connection error moves on to the next shop, up to
   MAX_SHOPS per order while a minute is left; each try is remembered as a failed visit.
8. Market intelligence for our own shop. After each Round 3 negotiation one line goes to market_intel.jsonl:
   the other shop's first ask, lowest ask and deal price against the list price, for that SKU and category.
   The public ledger shows only settled prices; first asks are seen only by a buyer who negotiates, and
   seller_r3.py prices against them. Only negotiations this buyer had anyway: no probing for prices.
   Every food order also logs its use_within_hours there ("type": "need"): restock.py buys only food that will
   still last that long when it sells. Every Round 3 order logs the list-price range of its acceptable SKUs and
   whether any shop had one ("type": "order"): restock.py stocks the price tiers orders ask for and nobody serves
   (11-03: 352 of 410 sofa orders found no shop).
