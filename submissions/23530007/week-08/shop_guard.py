"""Book-lead guard for the shop's warranty (user 11-07: a lead that gets caught is worth nothing).

    python shop_guard.py          one check (watch_round.sh runs it every 15 min)
    python shop_guard.py --dry    print what it would decide, change nothing

The warranty on goods (params.json shop.base: grades A and B, 72 h) costs refunds out of the book, the 0.5 part
of shop ALL, where we lead. Each check reads the board, keeps the lead over the next shop's book (24 h history in
.market/warranty_guard.json) and its slope over the last 4 h, and sets a level:

    2  A and B carry the warranty (params as they are)
    1  A only                                          when the lead < LEAD_B or it shrinks fast (< SHRINK_B)
    0  no warranty                                     when the lead < LEAD_ALL or it would be gone in 24 h

Going back up is one step at a time and needs a growing lead above a higher bar (hysteresis), so the level does
not flap. policy.shop_params() and seller_r3's card apply the level's grades (a stale guard, > 2 h, is ignored).
A level change is logged to logs/shop_guard.log, sent to the user through notify.py, and the kit is restarted
right after the next supply window closes so the agent card states the warranty the deals carry.
