"""Round 3 restock hook: what to buy for the shop, every 60 s.

    python restock.py --state .market          (agent.json "restock"; prints {"buy": [{"sku", "qty"}, ...]})

The market says neither what sells nor who wants what, so this learns it from two places:
  - the public ledger: every settled deal names the SKU sold (GET /api/ledger?after=N, read incrementally);
    counted per category with a half-life of HALF_LIFE hours, so the target follows what sells now
  - the shop's own log (seller_r3_log.jsonl): its deals, and buyers it had to turn away (no stock)

The limits come from policy.py (params.json) by the shop's situation: launch, cash tight (no expansion),
flush (deeper stock, dearer goods), wind-down (one unit per category, small stock), liquidation (buy nothing).

Per category the target stock is 1 unit (be in every order's shop list), plus up to `extra` more by the
category's share of recent market sales and our own sales. A category gets the SKU that sold most in it,
or, with no sales seen yet, the SKU nearest the category's median price (orders accept 0.5-1.5x a reference
price, so the median fits most). Limits, so stock never eats the shop:
  - cash kept back: keep_cash; stock at cost at most max_stock_share of equity (balance + stock at cost),
    so stock grows with the shop (unsold stock is a loss, goods pay 1 %/day)
  - goods listed above max_goods_price are skipped (one unit ties up too much cash), except up to
    max_goods_price_hot in a category with at least 30 % of the top category's market sales (Round 3 opened with
    beds/mattresses at 58 sales in 15 min, mean 209k, up to 392k)
  - food already in stock that no longer lasts the category's typical need is not counted as stock, so the
    category gets fresh units (the seller ships those to buyers who do not say their need); the stale ones still
    count against cash and stock limits, and sell to short-need buyers or at the near-date discount
  - food: only SKUs that still serve buyers when they sell: shelf life x 0.6 (a typical arrival) minus the time
    to sell must cover the use_within_hours buyers ask in that category (median of the food orders our buyer saw
    in 24 h, else NEED_SHARE x the SKU's shelf life: orders ask 10/25/50/75 % of it); if the best seller fails, a longer-lasting SKU of the
    category; quantity no more than our rate sells while it still lasts (food is thrown away at cost)
  - at most 3 units per line, 10 lines per run (the kit's limit); urgent lines first: sold-out categories
    with sales, then categories we do not cover yet
Supply windows (rule added when Round 3 opened, 11-03): supply opens once every 20 minutes for 3 minutes
(inventory.json "restock": open, opens_at, closes_at). Outside a window, more than LEAD seconds before it opens,
this buys nothing: the kit would spend up to 90 s per line waiting. In a window each category's target also
covers the next gap: our sales rate there x GAP_HOURS x 1.5, up to MAX_QTY units per line.
Within clear_window_hours of the end a category is only refilled up to what our sales rate in it can sell
before the end (policy.clearance's rule, seen from the buying side).
Lines go to goods first, food after (Round 3, first 13 h: goods took 31 % of our supply lines and made 75 % of
revenue, ~80k margin per line against ~17k for food; supply lines per window are the limit, so goods fill first
and food gets the lines left). Food is not dropped: it is most of our sales count, reviews and visits.
Price tiers (tier_wants): valuable goods categories also get one unit at each of up to 3 price points chosen to
answer the most orders (sofas: 86 % of our buyer's sofa orders found no shop on 11-03).
Below the bankruptcy line with (almost) nothing left to sell it files ("bankrupt": true).
The forum is not read (user, 11-06): posts are unverified, so demand comes only from the ledger, our own logs and
our buyer's orders.
It also keeps the shop's reputation for policy.py: the average stars of our newest Round 3 reviews on
/api/shops (the market shows the last 10), in restock_state.json "rep".
State (ledger position, decayed counts) in restock_state.json; every run logs one line to stderr.
