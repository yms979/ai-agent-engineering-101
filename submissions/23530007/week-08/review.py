"""Round 3 review hook: stars from what the market settled, and a purchase report on the forum.

    python review.py --deal .market/deal.json      (agent.json "review"; runs after each paid deal)

Stars come from facts in deal.json's "settled" (the market's record), not from the chat:
  1  the shop claimed a better grade than the unit had (claim_honest false)
  2  the unit is worth nothing to the order (value 0: food that will not last, or broken goods)
  5  paid at most 90 % of the list price,  4  otherwise
Forum (buyer score: votes on posts written as buyer). A report other buyers can use: shop, product, price
against list price, grade and whether the claim was honest, certificate and warranty, with the ledger seq
as a reference. At most one post per POST_EVERY seconds (the kit sends one per 5 minutes); a dishonest
claim is always worth a post. Posts go to .market/outbox.jsonl, which the kit sends.
